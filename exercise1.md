11.1 Warming up

Some common steps in a CI setup include linting, testing, and building. What are the specific tools for taking care of these steps in the ecosystem of the language you picked? 

Python

Pylint

Pylint is a linter, static code analyzer for Python language Offers the possibility to verify our code reporting errors such as syntaxis, logical, and coding standards, and make suggestions on how to refactor the code.

Pytest

Pytest allows us to perform automated tests that are considered to produce quality software. Some of the characteristics of Pytest are that can be run in parallel, detect tests, and has a simple syntax.

BuildMaster

BuildMaster is a self-hosted application tool, related to C/I. The tool is browser-based. 
Configuring applications can be done by building and deploying CI/CD or deploying from TeamCity for example.

What alternatives are there to set up the CI besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions?

The alternatives that we could use to set up the CI besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions are:

Buddy, Jira, Final Builder (from Vsoft), CruiseControl, Integrity, GoCD, Urbancode, Autorabit, CircleCI, Buildkite, TeamCity, or Bamboo.

Self-hosted or a cloud-based

By thinking of a small project, the option to choose could be cloud-based. It would be easier to update, maintain and secure. Also, it should be an advantage to not have the necessity to acquire a server and do all the setups to make it work. Can be relied on the cloud server to do this part of the job and kept the team members focused on other things.
